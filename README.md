My little space on the internet. I started this project with the intention to
getting to learn Next.js and practicing some web technologies.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

## Running

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
